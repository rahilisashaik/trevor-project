Receiver (Trevor Counselor):
Hi, you’ve reached the Trevor Project. My name is Avery. I’m really glad you called. I’m here to listen and support you. What’s going on tonight?

Caller:
Hi. I don’t really know how to say this, but… I don’t want to be here anymore. I don’t know if I can keep going.

Receiver:
Thank you for saying that. That’s really hard to share, and I want you to know I’m here with you. You’re not alone right now. Can I ask—have you been thinking about hurting yourself?

Caller:
Yeah. For a while. I’ve just been so tired. It feels like nothing I do matters, and no one would really care if I was gone.

Receiver:
I’m so sorry you’re feeling that way. That sounds like an incredibly heavy burden to be carrying on your own. But I want you to know—I care. And I’m really glad you reached out tonight.

Caller:
I didn’t know who else to talk to. I didn’t want to scare my friends. I feel like I’m just a problem.

Receiver:
You are not a problem. You’re a person who’s in pain right now, and who’s doing something really brave by asking for help. That takes a lot of strength, even when things feel hopeless.

Caller:
It’s just been building up. I’ve been pretending I’m okay for so long. But inside it’s like… I’m drowning.

Receiver:
That sounds incredibly overwhelming. When you say it’s been building up—can you tell me a little about what’s been going on in your life lately?

Caller:
School’s been a lot. I’ve been feeling like I can’t keep up. And I don’t really feel close to anyone anymore. I just feel like I’m failing at everything, and I don’t see the point.

Receiver:
You’re under so much pressure, and it sounds like you’ve been trying to carry it all alone. That kind of stress can make everything feel so much darker. But I want you to know there is a way through this, even if you can’t see it right now. I believe in that for you.

Caller:
I don’t know if I believe in anything anymore.

Receiver:
And that’s okay. You don’t have to believe in anything right now—I’ll believe for you. You don’t have to have a plan for everything. You just have to get through this moment. And I’ll be right here with you.

Caller:
Okay… I don’t know what I need. I just didn’t want to be alone tonight.

Receiver:
You’re not. I’m here. And we can take this one step at a time. No expectations, no pressure. Just you and me, figuring out what helps—even just a little bit—right now.

Caller:
Yeah… okay. That helps.

Receiver:
Good. That’s all we need for now. I’m really proud of you for picking up the phone. We’ll keep going together.
