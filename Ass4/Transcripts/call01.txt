Receiver (Trevor Counselor):
 Hi, you’ve reached the Trevor Project. My name’s Maya. I’m really glad you called tonight. What’s on your mind?
Caller (Jimmy):
 Hey. Uh… I’m not sure how to start. It’s kinda complicated.
Receiver:
 That’s okay. We can take things slow. I’m here to listen—whatever you’re going through, you don’t have to go through it alone.
Caller:
 Alright… um. My name’s Jimmy. I’m in a club at my college—it’s like a mentorship thing, with “bigs” and “littles.” And… I think I’m in love with my little. He’s a guy. And I’m a guy.
Receiver:
 Thank you for trusting me with that, Jimmy. That sounds like a big thing to be carrying on your own.
Caller:
 Yeah. I’ve never said it out loud. No one knows. I’ve always pushed this part of me down, but being around him—it just brought everything up. He’s sweet, kind, he looks up to me… and now I feel like a mess.
Receiver:
 That sounds really overwhelming. You’re navigating some really intense emotions while also trying to figure out what this means for you and your identity. That’s a lot—and it’s okay to feel conflicted.
Caller:
 I just don’t know who I am anymore. I don’t know if I’m gay, or bi, or what. And I’m scared of people finding out. The club’s super close, but… I don’t know if they'd be okay with it. Or if he’d freak out. He’s a year younger than me—what if I mess this up?
Receiver:
 You’re carrying so much uncertainty, and I hear how much you care—not just about him, but about doing the right thing. It makes sense that you're feeling stuck. You’re trying to understand yourself while also protecting this relationship and your place in the group. That’s not easy.
Caller:
 Yeah. I haven’t been sleeping. I’ve been replaying everything I say to him. I don’t know if I should just shut my feelings down and pretend. Or say something and risk everything.
Receiver:
 It sounds like you’re putting a lot of pressure on yourself to make the perfect choice. But there’s no single right answer here—just what feels safe and true for you. And wherever you are in that process, you deserve space to figure it out without shame.
Caller:
 I think I just feel broken. Like… why can’t I just be normal?
Receiver:
 Jimmy, you’re not broken. You’re human. And what you’re feeling—love, fear, confusion—it’s all valid. Being queer isn’t something you have to fix or hide. It’s part of who you are, and that’s something to be proud of—even if you’re still learning what it means.
Caller:
 Thanks. That’s… hard to hear. But it helps.
Receiver:
 Of course. You don’t have to have all the answers tonight. But we can talk about what feeling safe might look like, or what small next steps might feel manageable—whether that’s journaling, talking to someone you trust, or just giving yourself permission to feel what you feel.
Caller:
 Maybe I could talk to one of my close friends in the club. Someone who’s more open. I’ve been thinking about it, but I didn’t know if it was “allowed,” you know?
Receiver:
 It is allowed. Your truth is allowed. And so is asking for support. You don’t have to do this all on your own anymore.
Caller:
 Okay… I think I want to try. Not all at once. But something.
Receiver:
 That’s a beautiful first step. And I’m really proud of you for being honest tonight. You’re not alone, Jimmy—we’re here anytime you need.
