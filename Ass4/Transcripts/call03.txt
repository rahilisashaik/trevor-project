Receiver (Trevor Counselor):
Hi, you’ve reached the Trevor Project. I’m Kai. Thank you for calling tonight. I’m here to listen—whatever you’re going through, you don’t have to face it alone. What’s on your mind?

Caller (Vedant):
Hey. Um… I’ve never done something like this before. I’m not even sure why I called.

Receiver:
That’s totally okay. A lot of people don’t know exactly what to say at first. We can take things slow. Just whatever feels comfortable for you.

Caller:
Alright. So… I’m Vedant. I’m a junior in college. I’ve always been super academic—like, the straight-A, honors kid. My parents are really traditional Indian immigrants. Very strict, very focused on success. And I’ve always followed the rules, you know?

Receiver:
Sounds like there’s been a lot of pressure on you to meet expectations and stay on a certain path.

Caller:
Yeah. And recently, I joined this club at school—the kink club. I thought it would just be like a curiosity thing, maybe something to write about or analyze academically. But I actually… liked it. I felt things I didn’t expect to feel. And now I’m freaking out.

Receiver:
Thank you for being so open, Vedant. That sounds like a really confusing mix of discovery and doubt. It makes a lot of sense that this would bring up big questions for you.

Caller:
It’s just… I’ve never thought of myself as “queer” or anything. I’ve always assumed I was straight. But being in those meetings, talking openly about desires and dynamics, I started realizing some of the stuff that excites me doesn’t match the version of me I’ve always tried to be.

Receiver:
That realization can be really intense—especially when it challenges how you’ve seen yourself or how others have expected you to be. There’s no one right way to be queer, and there’s no one right timeline for figuring it out.

Caller:
I feel like if my parents ever found out, it would be over. Like—forget being gay—even the idea of kink is already something they’d never accept. It’s like I’m living two different lives and I don’t know which one is actually me.

Receiver:
You’re under a lot of pressure, not just from others, but from yourself. That tension between your background, your identity, and your desires is so real—and you’re not wrong or broken for feeling caught in the middle.

Caller:
I guess I just feel ashamed. Like, maybe I’m betraying who I’m supposed to be.

Receiver:
Shame can be heavy—and it often comes from trying to force ourselves into roles we didn’t choose. But exploring your identity, your desires, your truth… that’s not betrayal. That’s honesty. And you’re allowed to grow beyond the version of yourself that other people expect.

Caller:
I don’t even know if I’m ready to figure it all out. I just… I feel lost. And kind of scared.

Receiver:
You don’t have to have all the answers right now. Exploration isn’t a one-time decision—it’s a process. And you’re allowed to move at your own pace. You’re allowed to ask questions, to be unsure, to feel both fear and excitement. That’s part of being human.

Caller:
Yeah. I think I needed someone to say that. I haven’t talked to anyone about this—not even my closest friends. I thought they’d judge me.

Receiver:
That makes sense. But I want you to know that there are people out there who will accept you exactly as you are—not just for who you love or what you’re into, but for being honest, curious, and real. You’ve already taken a huge step by sharing this tonight.

Caller:
Thanks. I don’t feel fixed or anything… but I feel a little less alone.

Receiver:
That means a lot. You’re not alone, Vedant. And you never have to face this journey by yourself. We’re always here when you need someone to talk to.
