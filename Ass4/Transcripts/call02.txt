Receiver (Trevor Counselor):
Hi, you’ve reached the Trevor Project. My name is Riley. I’m really glad you reached out tonight. What’s going on?

Caller (Jonathon):
Hey. Uh… I don’t really know how to talk about this. It’s kind of weird.

Receiver:
That’s okay. You don’t have to have the perfect words—I’m here to listen, and this is a safe space. Whatever’s on your mind, I’m with you.

Caller:
Alright. So… my name’s Jonathon. I’m a sophomore. I live with my roommate, Kijun—we’ve been close since freshman year. He’s smart, sweet, a little moody but in a good way, and… I think I’m attracted to him. Like, sexually and emotionally. But I don’t know what to do with that.

Receiver:
Thank you for sharing that, Jonathon. That sounds like a lot to hold in, especially with someone you’re living with and care about.

Caller:
Yeah. I’ve been trying to ignore it, but it’s getting harder. The worst part is… he’s still kind of obsessed with his ex. He talks about her all the time, how much she hurt him, how he’s not over her. So now I feel selfish even thinking about how I feel.

Receiver:
That makes so much sense—you’re trying to process your own feelings while still being there for him emotionally. That’s a tough spot to be in, especially if you’re not sure how he might respond.

Caller:
Exactly. And I don’t even know if he’s into guys. I mean, he’s never said anything. I don’t think I’m even ready to label myself either—I just know what I feel when I’m around him. And it’s confusing as hell.

Receiver:
It’s completely okay to feel uncertain. Exploring attraction and identity doesn’t have to come with all the answers right away. What you’re feeling is real and valid—whether or not you choose to tell him, and whether or not you use a specific label.

Caller:
I guess I’m scared. If I say something, I risk everything—our friendship, our living situation… what if he gets weirded out and starts avoiding me?

Receiver:
That’s a really understandable fear. Your safety and comfort matter, and it’s okay to move at your own pace. You don’t owe anyone a confession—especially if you’re not sure it’s what’s best for you right now.

Caller:
So… should I just say nothing?

Receiver:
Only you can really know what feels right. But what if the question wasn’t “should I tell him or not,” and instead: what do I need right now to feel okay? That might be talking it through with a trusted friend, journaling to process your feelings, or just giving yourself space to exist in this tension without forcing a decision.

Caller:
That makes sense. I think I’ve been trying to force everything into a decision. I don’t even know what I want him to say back—I just… wanted someone to know how I feel.

Receiver:
And now someone does. And I’m really grateful you trusted me with that. What you’re experiencing isn’t weird—it’s human. You deserve to feel seen, and you don’t have to navigate this alone.

Caller:
Thank you. That honestly helps more than I thought it would.

Receiver:
Of course. I’m here any time. And whatever happens with Kijun—whether things change or stay the same—you’re worthy of care, honesty, and belonging. No pressure to rush. Just breathe. You’re doing great.
