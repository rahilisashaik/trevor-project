Receiver (Trevor Counselor):
Hi, you’ve reached the Trevor Project. My name is Leo. I’m really glad you called. Take your time—what would you like to talk about tonight?

Caller (Ryu):
Hey. Um… I’m Ryu. I don’t know, I guess I just have a lot going on in my head lately. Stuff I haven’t really said out loud.

Receiver:
That’s completely okay. You can share whatever you feel ready to—no pressure, no judgment. I’m here to listen.

Caller:
Okay. So… I used to be super academic. Like, high school was all grades, competitions, test prep—nothing else really. My parents are from Japan, and they’ve always been strict about school. No distractions, no dating, nothing like that.

Receiver:
Sounds like you grew up with a lot of structure and pressure to perform a certain way.

Caller:
Yeah. But since coming to college, I’ve been… changing, I guess. I joined this poker group. It’s super casual, just a few of us. There’s a tall Asian guy who’s kinda mysterious and really good at reading people, and this younger guy with a middle part who always jokes around. I’m not going to say their names—I don’t want to make it weird.

Receiver:
That’s totally fine. It sounds like this group has become meaningful to you.

Caller:
It has. And that’s what’s confusing me. I’ve started feeling… something. Not just attraction, but connection. To both of them. It’s not even like I’m sure if I’m gay or bi or what. And I’ve started wondering if maybe—maybe I’m into the idea of being with more than one person. Like a poly thing.

Receiver:
Thank you for trusting me with that, Ryu. You’re exploring some really complex, personal territory—and that takes a lot of courage.

Caller:
It’s just so out of my comfort zone. Where I’m from, there’s really only one way things are supposed to go: you study, you get a job, you find a wife. You don’t… experiment. You don’t even talk about this stuff.

Receiver:
That kind of cultural pressure can be really strong. And it’s understandable that stepping outside those norms would bring up a lot of questions and maybe even guilt or fear.

Caller:
Exactly. Part of me feels excited—like I’m finally letting myself feel things. But then another part of me is like… what if this is wrong? Or selfish? Or just something I made up because I’ve never had a “normal” relationship?

Receiver:
Ryu, what you’re feeling is valid—whatever label it ends up falling under, or even if it doesn’t have one yet. Exploring non-traditional relationship structures, or attraction to more than one person, doesn’t make you wrong. It just means you’re getting to know yourself more deeply.

Caller:
I don’t even know if they feel the same. Or if this is just a phase. Or if I’m trying to rebel against how I was raised.

Receiver:
Those are all really understandable questions. But you don’t need to have every answer right now. Sometimes it’s not about making a decision—it’s about making space for your feelings without shame.

Caller:
Yeah. I haven’t told anyone about this. I guess I thought it would just go away. But it hasn’t.

Receiver:
And now you’ve said it. You’ve given it air. That’s a huge first step, and I want you to know—you’re not alone in this. There are others who’ve felt this way, and there’s no one “right” way to be yourself.

Caller:
Thanks. I still feel confused, but… less ashamed, I guess.

Receiver:
That’s a powerful shift. You deserve to explore who you are without fear, without rushing, and without apology. And I’m proud of you for starting that journey tonight.
